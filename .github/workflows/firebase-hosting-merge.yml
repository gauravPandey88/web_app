# On pushes or pull requests to the main branch of the repo,
# this action will run `flutter build web`, and deploy the web app
# to the linked Firebase project.
#
# Setup: Firebase Hosting must be set up in your Firebase project.
# See https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/github-integration.
#
# Run `firebase init` -> "Set up GitHub Action deploys" in order to generate
# a value for `secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MYPROJECT` which this
# script needs. Running `init` will also generate some yaml action files; they
# can be removed and replaced with this one.
#
# Modify FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MYPROJECT and FIREBASE_PROJECT_NAME (Lines 56/58).
